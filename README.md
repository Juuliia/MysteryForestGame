# MysteryForestGame
Mystery Forest is a single-developer project created as part of my journey to learn game development and improve my skills. In this adventurous exploration game, players navigate an enchanted forest, defeat enemies, and uncover hidden secrets. The ultimate goal is to find your lost treasureâ€”its significance and purpose will be revealed as you explore the world.

I coded the game using C#, which has been an integral part of my learning process. As I am still a student and continuously learning about game development, your feedback is invaluable. Although Mystery Forest is considered finished and no further updates are planned, your insights will greatly influence and inspire my future projects.

Please note that while you are welcome to enjoy the game, I kindly request that you do not republish it anywhere. The game is intended for free use only, and any redistribution or commercial use is not permitted. Thank you for your understanding and for supporting my growth as a game developer!
