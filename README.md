# MysteryForestGame
Mystery Forest is a small, single-developer project created as part of my journey to learn game development and improve my skills. In this adventurous exploration game, players navigate an enchanted forest, defeat enemies, and uncover hidden secrets. The ultimate goal is to find your lost treasureâ€”its significance and purpose will be revealed as you explore the world.

I coded the game using C#, which has been a significant part of my learning process. As this was primarily an educational project, there will be no further updates or improvements. The game was developed using free assets and is intended for educational purposes and personal enjoyment.

This is a small game, and I have bigger projects planned for the future as I continue to grow as a game developer. Please note that the game is meant for free use only, and any commercial use or redistribution is not permitted. I kindly ask that you do not republish or redistribute the game in any form.

Thank you for your support and understanding, and I look forward to sharing more in the future!
