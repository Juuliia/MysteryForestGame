# MysteryForestGame
Mystery Forest is a single-developer project created as part of my journey to learn game development and improve my skills. In this adventurous exploration game, players navigate an enchanted forest, defeat enemies, and uncover hidden secrets. The ultimate goal is to find your lost treasureâ€”its significance and purpose will be revealed as you explore the world.

I coded the game using C#, which has been an integral part of my learning process. As I am still a student and continuously learning about game development, your feedback is invaluable. Mystery Forest is an ongoing project that may receive updates and improvements over time, your insights will greatly influence and inspire the development of this game.

Please note that this game was developed using free assets and is intended for educational purposes and personal enjoyment. I kindly ask that you do not republish or redistribute the game in any form. It is meant for free use only, and any commercial use or distribution is not permitted. Your feedback is greatly appreciated, as it helps me continue to learn and improve. Thank you for your support and understanding!
