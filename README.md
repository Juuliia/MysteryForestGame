# MysteryForestGame
Mystery Forest is a project I created as a way to build experience in game development before tackling more complex projects. I did put more thought into the story and world-building here than in my other test projects, but it's still primarily a learning project to develop my skills as a game developer.

Although it's not a perfect game, I’m sharing it to reflect on my journey and growth as a developer. It’s a way for me to look back and see how much I’ve learned through the process.

This game isn’t meant to be flawless—it’s more about the effort I put in and the lessons learned along the way. I’m sharing it to inspire others who may be starting their own game dev journeys, encouraging them to take the first step, even if things aren't perfect yet.

Built using C# in Unity, Mystery Forest is considered complete, and no further updates will be made. It uses free assets and was created for educational purposes and personal growth. I kindly ask that it not be republished or distributed commercially. Your feedback is incredibly valuable, and I appreciate your support as I continue learning and improving!
