# MysteryForestGame
Mystery Forest is a single-developer project created as part of my journey to learn game development and improve my skills. In this adventurous exploration game, players navigate an enchanted forest, defeat enemies, and uncover hidden secrets. The ultimate goal is to find your lost treasureâ€”its significance and purpose will be revealed as you explore the world.

I coded the game using C#, which has been an integral part of my learning process. As I am still a student and continuously learning about game development, your feedback is invaluable. Although Mystery Forest is considered finished and no further updates are planned, your insights will greatly influence and inspire my future projects. Thank you for playing and for contributing to my growth as a game developer!
